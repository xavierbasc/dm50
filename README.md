## Case
Freecad software has been used to design the casing.
The spaces have been optimized to reduce the size, continuously giving shape to the calculator and improving the user experience.

## Faceplate
A master faceplate has been designed although it can be exchanged by the user through a simple manual process.

The front plate is printed on photographic paper and cut to size, with professional results. A photo-quality printer is recommended, such as the Epson Ecotank.

To create the faceplate, the Inkscape tool has been used to edit the SVG and the font used is Latin Modern Math, licensed by the GUST Font License, developed by the TeX user group in Poland, and can be used for academic use. , commercial or academic.
